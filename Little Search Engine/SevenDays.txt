Like his sisters, Aaron quickly
rose to the top of the game.
But the number-one ranking eluded him.
His personal life, however,
has shined bright since his arrival to fame.
We could go months without talking to him.
He'd hang around a lot in Vegas, spending a lot
of time with Rod Stewart and some magician.
Well, it was me, Aaron Williams and Rod Stewart
going out every night for about 10 years,
crushing pussy and making money.
Aaron's chance to become the
top-ranked player in the world
finally came at the '96 Wimbledon finals.
What happened at Wimbledon '96
completely changed the trajectory
of Aaron Williams' life.
Will he do it? At 25 years old
finally win Wimbledon and grab
that number-one ranking he so desires?
Can he do it?
Can he beat the Belgian, Jens Goossens?
Ace.
- Three points away now.
- Here comes the guitar.
He is gunning for that title.
- 30-love.
- Another ace.
Are you kidding me?
148 miles per hour.
He's like, on another planet right now.
After those three aces,
there wasn't one person
who didn't think that
a four-bagger was coming.
And with it, a new tennis champion.
But what came next was
something quite different.
Here we go.
Championship point.
It appears he just whispered to himself,
"This is how we do it."
The hit Montell Jordan song that Aaron
sung backup vocals on this year.
Oh!
Oh, jeez.
This is not good.
We just hope he's all right.
You knew right away he was dead.
My Lord, I've never seen anything like this.
It was one of the great
tragedies of all time
and, technically,
it wasn't the impact that killed him.
But the impact gave him a heart
attack and that killed him.
So if you ask me, did Aaron kill him?
I'd say kinda.
The silver lining to that man's death
is that Aaron had set a...
a new speed record for a serve.
If the pressure of winning
Wimbledon wasn't enough,
now he's got a dead body on his hands.
Aaron probably should have
forfeited after killing a guy.
But he didn't because he's an asshole.
Second serve now, after killing a man.
Not a good sign for Williams.
Aaron lost, but remarkably,
killing a man and losing his
greatest shot at Wimbledon
and the number-one ranking still wasn't
as low as he would sink that day.
Let us start with a moment of silence
for Chauncey Kensington,
who gave his life for the game of tennis.
And now let's hear it for the runner-up,
Aaron Williams.
Thanks.
