Like his sisters, Aaron quickly
rose to the top of the game.
But the number-one ranking eluded him.
His personal life, however,
has shined bright since his arrival to fame.
We could go months without talking to him.
He'd hang around a lot in Vegas, spending a lot
of time with Rod Stewart and some magician.
Well, it was me, Aaron Williams and Rod Stewart
going out every night for about 10 years,
crushing pussy and making money.
Aaron's chance to become the
top-ranked player in the world
finally came at the '96 Wimbledon finals.
What happened at Wimbledon '96
completely changed the trajectory
of Aaron Williams' life.
Will he do it? At 25 years old
finally win Wimbledon and grab
that number-one ranking he so desires?
Can he do it?
Can he beat the Belgian, Jens Goossens?
